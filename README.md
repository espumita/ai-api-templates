# AI-Generated API Templates

This repository contains AI-generated example implementations of a marketplace API in multiple programming languages

Each implementation follows the same API specification while adhering to language-specific best practices.

## Available Implementations

- **C# ASP.NET Core** (`csharp-aspnetcore-sample/`) 
- **Kotlin Ktor** (`kotlin-ktor-sample/`)

## Documentation

For detailed API specifications, data models, and implementation guidelines, see [copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md).

## Docker Support

Both implementations include Docker support for easy deployment.

## Note

This project was generated with AI assistance to demonstrate consistent API implementation patterns across different programming languages and frameworks. Feel free to contribute additional language implementations that maintain feature parity with existing templates.
